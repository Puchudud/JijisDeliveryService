1. Explain briefly what your project does and how it works.

     In our project we are going to have the character explore a small, pre-made map that has 3 "keys" the player needs
     to find in order to bring back to the start in order to win. Throughout the map there are enemies who will chase
     the player when they get within a certain radius of the player and if they catch the character you loose.
